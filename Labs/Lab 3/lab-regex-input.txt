Employers want to see a strong aptitude for data science in their new hires, 
but this skill isn�t always easy to demonstrate in an interview. That�s 
why we�ve created an extensive series discussing the importance of data 
science and how you can increase your employability by building this skill. 
Here, you�ll learn how to build a strong data science portfolio that 
showcases your skills and helps you land that job.

In the past few posts in this series, we�ve talked about how to build a data 
science project that tells a story, how to build an end to end machine learning 
project, and how to setup a data science blog. In this post, we�ll take a step 
back, and focus on your portfolio at a high level. We�ll discuss what skills 
employers want to see a candidate demonstrate, and how to build a portfolio 
that demonstrates all of those skills effectively. We�ll include examples of 
what each project in your portfolio should look like, and give you suggestions 
on how to get started.

After reading this post, you should have a good understanding of why you should 
build a data science portfolio, and how to go about doing it.

What Employers Look For
When employers hire, they�re looking for someone who can add value to their business. 
Often, this means someone who has skills that can generate revenue and opportunities 
for the business. As a data scientist, you add value to a business in one of 4 main ways:

Extracting insights from raw data, and presenting those insights to others.
An example would be analyzing ad click rates, and discovering that it�s much more cost 
effective to advertise to people who are 18 to 21 then to people who are 21 to 25 � this 
adds business value by allowing the business to optimize its ad spend.

Building systems that offer direct value to the customer.
An example would be a data scientist at Facebook optimizing the news feed to show better 
results to users � this generates direct revenue for Facebook because more news feed 
engagement means more ad engagement.

Building systems that offer direct value to others in the organization.
An example would be building a script that automatically aggregates data from 3 databases 
and generates a clean dataset for others to analyze � this adds value by making it faster 
for others to do their work.

Sharing your expertise with others in the organization.
An example is chatting with a product manager about how to build a feature that requires 
machine learning algorithms � this adds value by preventing unrealistic timelines, or a 
semi-functional product.

Unsurprisingly, when employers look at candidates to hire, they look at people who can 
do one or more of the four things above (the exact ones they look at depend on the company 
and role). In order to demonstrate that you can aid a business in the 4 areas listed above, 
you need to demonstrate some combination of these skills:

Ability to communicate
Ability to collaborate with others
Technical competence
Ability to reason about data
Motivation and ability to take initiative

A well-rounded portfolio should show off your skills in each of the above areas, and be 
relatively easy for someone to scan � each portfolio item should be well documented and 
explained, so a hiring manager is able to quickly evaluate your portfolio.
